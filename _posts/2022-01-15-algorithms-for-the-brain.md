Week one down, and I can finally stop to catch my breath!  

This first week saw us take what we learned in prep from 'A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms' and apply it to various mental models. After a week of focused practice, I can already see improvement in my problem-solving skills. Putting names to pointer models such as start/end, anchor/runner, and reader/writer make it far easier to think through potential solutions. 

Linked lists are easy to grasp at a high level, but always seem to get tricky when it comes to the implementation phase. Keeping the previous, current, and next pointers straight in my head takes a lot of focus. I need to identify more clearly and accurately where and what pointers are doing in my written model prior to coding. 

When it comes to recursion, I find myself slowly getting better. It is a topic I foresee myself needing to continually practice and work at. For better or worse, it looks like next week should give plenty of both. 

Overall, week one flew by. It was mentally tiring but satisfying.
