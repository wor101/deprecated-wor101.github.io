I started my journey at Launch School in September of 2020. At the time, the Capstone Program seemed like a distant, unreachable goal. Now, on a snowy Friday in January of 2022, I am finishing my last pre-Capstone task by launching my personal website. On Monday, I and my fellow cohorts will begin what I expect to be an intense, fast-paced learning experience in which we identify a problem, devise a solution, build an application, and deploy it for all to use. It is exciting and nerve-racking, but hopefully in six months I will be launching into a new career as a software developer.
