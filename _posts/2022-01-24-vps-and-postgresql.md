Week two wrapped up with dynamic programming and backtracking. It is worth exploring further, but I now have a solid basis to build on. Two weeks of algorithm review have improved my problem-solving skills and increased my confidence when live coding. The mock interview after week one was a great indicator of how far I have come and what I still need to improve upon. 

This weekend was spent preparing for system design. In preparation I launched a virtual private server on DigitalOcean with a barebones frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database. Nginx served as a reverse proxy and Certbot was used to acquire an SSL certificate to allow secure HTTPS traffic.  

Besides a configuration headache with Nginx, the most time-consuming portion of the weekend was refreshing my memory of PostgreSQL and integrating it into a Node backend. It has been a year since I used PostgreSQL extensively and my SQL skills have gotten a little rusty. In addition, Iâ€™ve previously only integrated PostgreSQL into a Ruby backend, and I had to learn the node-postrges package. As for my SQL skills, I fortunately have extensive notes that made jumping back in painless.
